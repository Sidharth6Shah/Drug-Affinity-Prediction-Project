GNN MODEL ARCHITECTURE FOR BINDING AFFINITY PREDICTION
========================================================

BASIC IDEA
----------
You have two inputs:
1. Ligand graph - describes the drug molecule's structure
2. Protein embedding - describes the protein's characteristics

You need to combine them to predict one number (the binding affinity).


THE STEPS
---------

1. Process the ligand through the GNN
   - Input: Variable-sized graph with atom features
   - The GNN layers learn patterns in the molecular structure
   - Output: Fixed-size vector (e.g., 128 dimensions) representing the ligand

2. Concatenate ligand + protein
   - GNN output: 128-dim ligand embedding
   - Protein embedding: 480-dim protein features
   - Combined: 608-dim vector containing both ligand and protein info

3. Pass through a regular neural network (MLP)
   - Input: 608-dim combined features
   - Hidden layers learn how ligand and protein interact
   - Output: 1 number (predicted binding affinity)


VISUAL FLOW
-----------

Ligand Graph (variable size)
    ↓
  GNN (3 layers)
    ↓
128-dim ligand embedding  →  CONCAT  →  MLP  →  Binding Affinity
                                ↑              (1 number)
                                |
                    480-dim protein embedding


WHY IT WORKS
------------
- The GNN understands the drug molecule's chemistry
- The protein embedding captures protein characteristics
- The MLP learns which drug-protein combinations bind strongly
